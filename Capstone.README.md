# DWDM Project on TEXT SUMMARIZATION
 
A project on Text Summarization given in DWDM subject by Charusat University.

## What is Text Summarization?

If you are interested in understanding how the system works and its implementation, we wrote a Document on [Document Sumarization](https://github.com/pratyay12/DWDM-Project/blob/master/DWDM%20Document.pdf).

We also made a presentation of our project. To view the video, click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QUH9GHW4rCv8uQK5Oa4ByTznNfjJNOaP).

[Document_Summarizer.ipynb](https://github.com/pratyay12/DWDM-Project/blob/master/Document_Summarizer.ipynb) is our code for the project. It can be run on any python environment such as Jupyter notebook but we did it on google colab.

[sample.txt](https://github.com/pratyay12/DWDM-Project/blob/master/sample.txt) is the text we summarized and obtained results in [final3.txt](https://github.com/pratyay12/DWDM-Project/blob/master/final3.txt).
